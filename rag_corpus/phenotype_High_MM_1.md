# Phenotype High_MM_1 – Cardio-pulmonary multimorbidity with cirrhosis

## Key idea
High-multimorbidity patients dominated by chronic cardio-pulmonary disease and cirrhosis, with intermediate acute physiological derangement.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~38% of the high-multimorbidity stratum (413/1100), making it the most common high-MM phenotype.
- Enriched for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cirrhosis as primary diagnoses.
- Diabetes and cancer are frequent but less dominant than in High_MM_0 and High_MM_2.
- Multi-organ failure is present but less common than in High_MM_0.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS and physiology scores are close to or slightly below the stratum mean, indicating moderate acute severity compared with High_MM_0.
- Oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) is closer to the stratum average, and albumin is relatively preserved.
- Intervention intensity (TISS) is lower than in the multi-organ failure phenotype High_MM_0.
- Adjusted models show **lower mortality risk** than High_MM_0, but risk remains substantial within the high-multimorbidity stratum.
