# Phenotype High_MM_0 – Diabetic multi-organ failure

## Key idea
High-multimorbidity patients with multi-organ failure on a background of diabetes and cancer, exhibiting the most severe acute physiology and organ support needs in this stratum.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~32% of the high-multimorbidity stratum (346/1100).
- Very high prevalence of acute respiratory failure / multi-organ system failure as the primary diagnosis.
- Diabetes is common, and many patients have documented cancer, including metastatic or multi-organ malignant disease.
- Cirrhosis and coma diagnoses are more frequent than in the cardio-dominant phenotypes.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- Highest acute severity: APS and SUPPORT physiology scores are clearly above the stratum mean, and TISS scores indicate the most intensive interventions.
- Oxygenation is the most impaired within the high-multimorbidity stratum, with lower PaO2/FiO2 ratios.
- Biochemical derangement (e.g. creatinine, bilirubin) is more pronounced than in the other high-multimorbidity phenotypes.
- In adjusted survival models, this phenotype is the **highest-risk reference group**, with both High_MM_1 and High_MM_2 showing lower hazards of death relative to High_MM_0.
