# Phenotype Mid_MM_2 – Cardiovascular and lung cancer with preserved physiology

## Key idea
Mid-multimorbidity patients with cardiovascular disease and lung cancer who, despite substantial chronic illness, have relatively preserved acute physiology at the day-3 measurement.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~30% of the mid-multimorbidity stratum (1131/3822).
- High prevalence of congestive heart failure and lung cancer as primary diagnoses.
- Overall cancer burden is high; diabetes is moderately common.
- Multi-organ failure diagnoses occur but are less frequent than in Mid_MM_1.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS, physiology and TISS scores are lower than in Mid_MM_1, indicating less acute derangement and fewer interventions.
- Patients have the **best oxygenation** (higher PaO2/FiO2) within the mid-multimorbidity stratum, with albumin in the preserved range.
- Adjusted mortality risk is **intermediate**: higher than the COPD-dominant phenotype Mid_MM_0 but lower than the malignant multi-organ failure phenotype Mid_MM_1.
