# Phenotype Mid_MM_0 – Elderly COPD-dominant multimorbidity

## Key idea
Moderately multimorbid, older patients dominated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with relatively modest acute physiology abnormalities at day-3.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~26% of the mid-multimorbidity stratum (1002/3822).
- High prevalence of COPD as the primary diagnosis, with additional contributions from heart failure and acute respiratory failure.
- Diabetes and cancer are present but not defining features; cirrhosis and coma diagnoses are relatively uncommon.
- Represents a chronic lung-disease multimorbidity pattern with limited additional organ failure.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- Patients are older on average than the other mid-multimorbidity phenotypes.
- APS and SUPPORT physiology scores are slightly below the stratum mean, and TISS scores are lower, indicating less intense intervention.
- Oxygenation is modestly impaired, but biochemical markers and albumin are relatively preserved.
- In Cox models, this phenotype serves as the **reference group** with the **lowest adjusted mortality risk** within the mid-multimorbidity stratum.
