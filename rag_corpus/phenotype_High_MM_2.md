# Phenotype High_MM_2 – Chronic heart failure with cancer and preserved physiology

## Key idea
High-multimorbidity patients with prominent congestive heart failure and solid-organ malignancy, but comparatively preserved acute physiology at the day-3 assessment.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~31% of the high-multimorbidity stratum (341/1100).
- Very high prevalence of congestive heart failure as the primary diagnosis.
- Solid-organ cancers (including lung and colon cancer) are common, and overall cancer burden is higher than in High_MM_1.
- Diabetes is frequent; cirrhosis and coma are less prominent than in High_MM_0 and High_MM_1.
- Multi-organ failure diagnoses are uncommon.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS and physiology scores are the lowest within the high-multimorbidity stratum, reflecting comparatively milder acute derangement.
- Patients show the **best oxygenation** (higher PaO2/FiO2) and relatively preserved albumin.
- TISS scores indicate fewer therapeutic interventions than in High_MM_0.
- Despite substantial chronic disease, adjusted mortality risk is **lower than High_MM_0**, broadly similar to or slightly better than the cardio-cirrhotic phenotype High_MM_1.
