# Phenotype Low_MM_1 – Coma-dominant low-multimorbidity phenotype

## Key idea
Low-multimorbidity patients whose main defining feature is coma at presentation, with moderate acute physiological abnormalities and high short-term mortality.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~11% of the low-multimorbidity stratum (477/4183), the smallest low-MM phenotype.
- Very high prevalence of coma as the primary diagnosis; acute respiratory failure is also more common than in Low_MM_0.
- Cancer burden is lower than in Low_MM_0, and cirrhosis is rare; diabetes is present in a minority.
- Overall comorbidity count is low, but neurological injury is prominent.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- Patients are slightly older on average than Low_MM_0, with high coma scale scores and greater use of intensive interventions (higher TISS).
- APS and physiology scores are close to the stratum mean; oxygenation is modestly impaired but not extreme.
- In adjusted survival models, this phenotype has the **highest mortality risk** within the low-multimorbidity stratum, significantly higher than the cancer-dominant Low_MM_0 phenotype.
