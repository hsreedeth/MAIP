# Phenotype Low_MM_0 – Solid-organ cancer with low acute severity

## Key idea
Low-multimorbidity patients whose main burden is advanced solid-organ cancer, particularly lung and colon cancer, but with relatively mild acute physiological disturbance at day-3.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~30% of the low-multimorbidity stratum (1256/4183).
- Very high prevalence of lung and colon cancer; the aggregate cancer measure indicates that most patients have active or metastatic malignancy.
- Diabetes, dementia and other comorbidities are relatively uncommon; multi-organ failure diagnoses are infrequent.
- Represents a predominantly oncological phenotype with limited additional chronic disease.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS and SUPPORT physiology scores are well below the stratum mean, and TISS scores suggest low levels of intensive interventions.
- Oxygenation is relatively good (higher PaO2/FiO2), and albumin is preserved.
- Despite modest acute derangement, mortality is substantial because of underlying malignancy; in Cox models this phenotype serves as the **reference group** for the low-multimorbidity stratum, with Low_MM_1 showing higher risk and Low_MM_2 lower risk.
