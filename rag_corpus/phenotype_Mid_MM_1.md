# Phenotype Mid_MM_1 – Malignant multi-organ failure with cirrhosis

## Key idea
Mid-multimorbidity patients with multi-organ failure on a background of malignancy and cirrhosis, showing the most severe acute physiology and highest short-term mortality risk in this stratum.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~44% of the mid-multimorbidity stratum (1689/3822), the largest mid-MM phenotype.
- Very high prevalence of acute respiratory failure / multi-organ system failure as the primary diagnosis.
- Frequent MOSF with malignancy, cirrhosis and coma diagnoses.
- Cancer is common, and diabetes is present in a substantial minority.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS and physiology scores are clearly above the stratum mean; TISS scores are also elevated, reflecting heavy organ support.
- Oxygenation is impaired, and albumin is lower than in Mid_MM_0 and Mid_MM_2, consistent with critical illness and liver disease.
- This phenotype has the **highest adjusted mortality hazard** in the mid-multimorbidity stratum, significantly higher than Mid_MM_0 and higher than Mid_MM_2.
