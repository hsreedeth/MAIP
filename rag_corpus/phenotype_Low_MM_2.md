# Phenotype Low_MM_2 – Acute multi-organ failure with malignancy

## Key idea
Low-multimorbidity patients who present with acute respiratory failure or multi-organ failure, often in the context of malignancy, and have the most pronounced acute physiological derangement in this stratum.

## Comorbidity profile
- Comprises ~59% of the low-multimorbidity stratum (2450/4183), the most common low-MM phenotype.
- Very high prevalence of acute respiratory failure / multi-organ system failure, with frequent MOSF-with-malignancy diagnoses.
- Cancer is common, and diabetes is present in a substantial minority.
- Background comorbidity count is low, distinguishing these patients from the high-multimorbidity strata.

## Acute physiology and outcomes
- APS, physiology and TISS scores are clearly above the low-MM stratum mean, indicating greater acute severity and more intensive organ support than Low_MM_0.
- Oxygenation is the most impaired (lower PaO2/FiO2) within the low-multimorbidity stratum; albumin is somewhat reduced.
- Despite this acute derangement, adjusted mortality risk is **lower than Low_MM_0** and markedly lower than the coma-dominant phenotype Low_MM_1, suggesting that some acute organ failures in this low-comorbidity group remain partially reversible.
